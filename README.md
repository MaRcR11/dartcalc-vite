# dartcalc
Finding all possibilities checking out in darts.
## How it works 
Between 2-170 remaining points in darts you got the possibility to end the game with an amount of darts between 1-3.
Common players might not play or know to play all the calculated checkouts, they would go for the most easiest ways. 
This is just an calculating purpose (not intuitive problem).

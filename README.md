# dartcalc
Finding all possibilities checking out in darts.
## How it works 
Between 2-170 remaining points in darts you got the possibility to end the game with an amount of darts between 1-3.
Common players might not play or know to play all the calculated checkouts, they would go for the most easiest ways. 
This is just an calculating purpose (not intuitive problem).
## Made up to work in console 
Just clone https://github.com/MaRcR11/dartcalc.git, then start in console.
As an extension you got the possibility to extend a while loop and print out all calculated possibilities from 2-170.
## Made up to work in web
- Just open https://marcr11.github.io/dartcalc/ and you got a python console.
- External Vite-Version https://vitejs-vite-n8mru1--3000.local.webcontainer.io/
